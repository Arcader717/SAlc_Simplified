- I found SQLAlchemy too difficult to try to understand, so I will understand it and make it easier



## Roadmap

- [x] v0.4 - I plan to finish functionality for the createTable function and the createColumn function
- [ ] v0.5 - I plan to add functionality for basic SQL statements like INSERT, UPDATE, and POP.
